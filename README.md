# LoyaltyCrawler

In this project, the student group is to design and implement a web crawler application for the sponsor. The objective of this application is to sift, or “crawl” through the web obtaining any artifacts determined to be relevant to loyalty rewards programs for customers. These artifacts can then be categorized, organized, and examined according to predetermined requirements or user preference by means of an easy-to-use user interface. The web crawler and accompanying user interface are to be implemented as a web based application that is user-friendly, efficient, and modular.
